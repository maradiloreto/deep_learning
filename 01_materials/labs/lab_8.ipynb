        "### **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The field of open-ended language generation has advanced rapidly, fueled by the emergence of even more powerful transformer-based language models. These models, trained on vast quantities of text data, surpass predecessors like OpenAI's GPT-2. Cutting-edge language models like GPT-3 and its variations now lead the way. Additionally, continuous innovation in decoding methods further improves the quality of generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explore prominent decoding methods and how you can employ them using the `transformers` library for your language generation tasks.  \n",

        "**Understanding Auto-regressive Language Generation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Auto-regressive language generation remains a fundamental technique  ([refresher](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/)). Briefly, it works on the principle that a word sequence's probability distribution can be broken down as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) \\text{ ,with }  w_{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $W_0$ is the starting context. The sequence length, $T$, is dictated by when the model produces an EOS (end-of-sequence) token.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decoding Strategies**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at the prevalent decoding techniques available in the `transformers` library:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Greedy Search:**  A straightforward approach; in each step, the word with the highest probability is selected.\n",
        "* **Beam Search:** Keeps track of multiple top candidates throughout generation, offering  more refined results.\n",
        "* **Top-K Sampling:** Randomly picks from the top 'K' most likely words; introduces variety and unexpected text directions.\n",
        "* **Top-p Sampling (Nucleus Sampling):** Selects from a subset of words whose cumulative probability accounts for a defined percentage 'p'; balances predictability and creativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Decoding techniques have become significantly more sophisticated alongside model improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Availability**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use auto-regressive language generation with models like GPT-2, GPT-3 (through APIs), XLNet, OpenAI-GPT, CTRL, TransfoXL, XLM, BART, T5, and others in PyTorch and TensorFlow >= 2.0.\n"

For this example, we will load the `TFGP2LMHeadModel` and `GPT2Tokenizer` classes from the `transformers` library. The `TF` prefix indicates that we are using the TensorFlow version of the model.
